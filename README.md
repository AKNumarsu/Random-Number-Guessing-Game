# Random-Number-Guessing-Game
A game where the user has 6 attempts to guess a number within a certain range given by the system.
The system will prompt an integer input along with the range in which the target resides (EX: 10-50)
The user will have 6 attempts to guess the target. After every failed attempt, the system will respond
if the guess is too high or too low. If the user gets all 6 guesses wrong, the system will reveal the
answer.
